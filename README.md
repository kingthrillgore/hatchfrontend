## User Story

Syd is a restaurant manager at a new restaurant, Sydâ€™s Tacos and Parfaits. She needs to gather data on the size of each party being seated throughout the day to ensure her tables have the right number of chairs. The only data she needs to collect now is the number of people in a party. She should be able to input a number and save it. Once saved, she should be shown the total number of times she has entered that number. 

Syd would like to be able to see the totals at the end of the day, but has agreed with the development team that this will be handled in another user story and is currently out of scope.
